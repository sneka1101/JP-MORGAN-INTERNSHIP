# JP Morgan Forage Internship 
This project is part of the JP Morgan Forage Virtual Internship. It demonstrates basic object-oriented programming concepts by simulating the behavior of a car. The program allows interaction with the car through accelerating, braking, checking the odometer, and viewing the average speed. The car tracks its total distance traveled and calculates its average speed based on time.

## Features
- **Accelerate**: Increases the car's speed by 5 units.
- **Brake**: Decreases the car's speed by 5 units.
- **Odometer**: Tracks the total distance the car has traveled.
- **Average Speed**: Calculates the car's average speed based on the distance and time.
